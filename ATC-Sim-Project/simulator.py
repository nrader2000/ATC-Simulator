# The product we were assigned with developing is an Air Traffic Control 
# Simulator, based on the atc-sim.com web app. This should be able to simulate 
# planes approaching and taking off from the STL (St. Louis Lambert) airport, 
# as well as planes passing through the area. The product should also give the 
# user the ability to act as an air traffic controller by giving the user the 
# necessary commands to be able to direct and control each of the simulated planes 
# around the airport. Just as any Air Traffic Controller would be able to do.
