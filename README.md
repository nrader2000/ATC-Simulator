 ## Software Product: 
 - The product we were assigned with developing is an Air Traffic Control Simulator, based on the atc-sim.com web app. This should be able to simulate planes approaching and taking off from the STL (St. Louis Lambert) airport, as well as planes passing through the area. The product should also give the user the ability to act as an air traffic controller by giving the user the necessary commands to be able to direct and control each of the simulated planes around the airport. Just as any Air Traffic Controller would be able to do.
